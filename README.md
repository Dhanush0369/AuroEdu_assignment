# Process: 

# Connect to the PostgreSQL database and define the database table.

# Implement the add_document API to add documents.

# Generate vector embeddings for the documents and store them in the database.

# Implement the select_documents API to allow users to specify document preferences.

# Implement the ask_question API to handle user queries.


# All the APIs are tested and running perfectly
# There is a more efficient method where we donâ€™t need to store embeddings manually, PGVector can automate the process
# However, due to time constraints, I was unable to implement it
